## Overview

In this example, we demonstrate the generation of an `i_valid` signal with a specific pattern. When `i_valid` is high, it will transition to a low state in the subsequent `LATENCY` clock cycles, all while adhering to predefined constraints. Additionally, an assertion has been implemented to ensure the desired behavior is maintained throughout the simulation.
